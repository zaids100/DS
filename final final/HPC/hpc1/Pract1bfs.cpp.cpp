  /*
  * Parallel Breadth First Search (BFS) Implementation using OpenMP
  * =============================================================
  *
  * Overview:
  * ---------
  * This program implements a parallel version of the Breadth-First Search algorithm
  * for traversing graphs. It demonstrates both basic graph operations and parallel
  * processing concepts using OpenMP.
  *
  * Key Technologies:
  * ----------------
  * 1. OpenMP (#pragma omp)
  *    - A parallel programming API for shared-memory multiprocessing
  *    - Used here for parallel task execution and thread management
  *    - Examples in other contexts: parallel for loops, matrix multiplication
  *    - Directives used:
  *      #pragma omp parallel      // Creates parallel region with multiple threads
  *      #pragma omp single nowait // Single thread executes, others don't wait
  *      #pragma omp task          // Creates new task for parallel execution
  *      #pragma omp parallel for  // Distributes loop iterations among threads
  *
  * 2. STL Containers
  *    - vector<>: Dynamic arrays for adjacency lists
  *    - queue<>: FIFO data structure for BFS traversal
  *
  * Data Structures:
  * ---------------
  * 1. Graph (struct)
  *    - Adjacency list representation using vector<vector<int>>
  *    - Allows O(1) access to vertices and O(degree) traversal of neighbors
  *
  * 2. BFS-specific structures:
  *    - visited[]: Boolean array tracking visited vertices
  *    - queue: Maintains vertices to be explored
  *
  * Complexity Analysis:
  * -------------------
  * Time Complexity:
  * - Sequential: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
  * - Parallel: O((V + E)/p) theoretical, where p = number of processors
  *
  * Space Complexity:
  * - O(V + E) for adjacency list
  * - O(V) for visited array and queue
  *
  * Parallel Performance Factors:
  * ---------------------------
  * 1. Critical Section Overhead
  * 2. Load Balancing
  * 3. Graph Structure/Density
  * 4. Memory Access Patterns
  * 5. Thread Synchronization Cost
  *
  * Q&A Section:
  * -----------
  * Q1: What is BFS and why use it?
  * A1: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the current
  *     depth before moving to vertices at the next depth level. Used in shortest
  *     path finding, web crawling, and network analysis.
  *
  * Q2: Why use adjacency lists over matrices?
  * A2: Adjacency lists are more space-efficient for sparse graphs O(V+E) vs O(VÂ²),
  *     and provide faster iteration over neighbors.
  *
  * Q3: What does #pragma omp parallel for do?
  * A3: It distributes loop iterations across multiple threads, enabling parallel
  *     processing of independent operations.
  *
  * Q4: Why is the critical section necessary?
  * A4: To prevent race conditions when multiple threads try to update shared data
  *     (visited array and queue) simultaneously.
  *
  * Q5: What's the purpose of double-checking visited[v]?
  * A5: It's a performance optimization that reduces critical section contention
  *     by checking visited status before entering the critical section.
  *
  * Q6: How does parallel BFS differ from sequential BFS?
  * A6: Parallel BFS processes multiple neighbors concurrently, but requires
  *     synchronization for shared data access.
  *
  * Q7: What factors affect parallel performance?
  * A7: Graph structure, thread overhead, memory access patterns, load balancing,
  *     and critical section contention.
  *
  * Q8: Why use vector<bool> for visited array?
  * A8: It's space-efficient as it typically uses 1 bit per boolean instead of
  *     1 byte, though it may have performance tradeoffs.
  *
  * Q9: How does load balancing affect performance?
  * A9: Uneven distribution of edges among vertices can lead to some threads
  *     doing more work than others, reducing parallel efficiency.
  *
  * Q10: What's the impact of graph density on performance?
  * A10: Denser graphs have more edges to process but may suffer from increased
  *      critical section contention.
  *
  * Q11: How can we optimize the parallel implementation?
  * A11: Use larger grain sizes, minimize critical sections, employ better
  *      load balancing, and consider graph partitioning.
  *
  * Q12: What's the significance of the queue in BFS?
  * A12: The queue maintains the FIFO order necessary for level-by-level
  *      traversal characteristic of BFS.
  *
  * Q13: How does thread count affect performance?
  * A13: More threads can improve performance up to a point, after which
  *      overhead and contention may degrade performance.
  *
  * Q14: Why is the graph undirected?
  * A14: Each edge is bidirectional (u->v and v->u), suitable for applications
  *      like social networks or road systems.
  *
  * Q15: What are the memory access patterns in this implementation?
  * A15: Random access patterns when accessing adjacency lists and visited array,
  *      which can affect cache performance.
  *
  * Q16: What are the limitations of this implementation?
  * A16: - No handling of disconnected components
  *      - Potential overhead for small graphs
  *      - Memory contention in dense graphs
  *
  * Q17: What is the purpose of #pragma omp critical?
  * A17: Ensures mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread to execute a code block at a time,
  *      preventing race conditions in shared resource access.
  *
  * Q18: How does #pragma omp taskwait work in OpenMP?
  * A18: Forces the current thread to wait until all its child tasks complete,
  *      useful for synchronization points in the algorithm.
  *
  * Q19: What is the role of OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable?
  * A19: Sets the default number of threads for parallel regions in OpenMP programs,
  *      allowing runtime control of parallelism level.
  *
  * Q20: How does #pragma omp atomic differ from critical?
  * A20: Provides faster, hardware-supported atomic operations for simple updates to shared variables,
  *      more efficient than critical sections for single operations.
  *
  * Q21: What is the purpose of #pragma omp barrier?
  * A21: Creates a synchronization point where all threads in a parallel region must wait
  *      before any can proceed, ensuring coordinated execution.
